Integrate WP Grid Builder with Bricks plugin.

== Description ==

= WP Grid Builder - Bricks =

This add-on requires at least Bricks v1.5.5

This add-on integrates WP Grid Builder with Bricks plugin.
It adds 2 new elements for Bricks in order to easily add grids and facets in the editor.
These elements are rendered in the editor for a better experience compared to shortcodes.

Facets offer the possibility to filter several elements from Bricks.

This add-on also improves filtering performance.
This will be faster than using custom queries and archive results filtering methods.

**Key Features:**

* Add Grid element
* Add Facet element
* Filter Posts element
* Filter Products element
* Filter Container, Bloc, Div elements

Grids can also be used to display results from Bricks archive templates.

This add-on does not support the "Infinite scroll" option from Bricks for the elements listed above.
However, you can use a facet to load more content on click or scroll.
We also strongly recommend using a pagination facet instead of the pagination included in Bricks.

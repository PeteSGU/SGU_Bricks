= Setting up the Social Wall WordPress Plugin =

The Social Wall plugin is brand new and so we're currently working on improving our documentation for it. If you have an issue or question please submit a support ticket and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.

1) Once you've installed the Social Wall plugin click on the "Social Feeds" item in your WordPress menu

2) If you haven't installed and activated Instagram Feed Pro, Custom Facebook Feed Pro, Custom Twitter Feeds Pro, and/or Feeds for YouTube Pro, do so now. Follow the setup directions for each plugin to connect an account or get an access token.

3) Navigate to the Customize and Style pages to customize your Social Wall.

4) Copy the generated shortcode on the "Configure" tab (ex. [social-wall][instagram-feed][custom-facebook-feed][custom-twitter-feeds][youtube-feeds][/social-wall]) shortcode and paste it into any page, post or widget where you want the social media feed to appear.

5) You can paste the [social-wall][instagram-feed][custom-facebook-feed][custom-twitter-feeds][youtube-feeds][/social-wall] shortcode directly into your page editor.

6) You can use the default WordPress 'Text' widget to display your social media feed in a sidebar or other widget area.

7) View your website to see your social media feed(s) in all their glory!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I display multiple feeds on my site or on the same page? =

Yep. You can display multiple feeds by using our built-in shortcode options, for example: `[social-wall][youtube-feed channel="smashballoon" num=3][/social-wall]`.

= How do I embed a social wall feed directly into a WordPress page template? =

You can embed your social wall feed directly into a template file by using the WordPress [do_shortcode](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/do_shortcode) function: `<?php echo do_shortcode('[social-wall][instagram-feed][custom-facebook-feed][custom-twitter-feeds][youtube-feeds][/social-wall]'); ?>`.

= Will Social Wall work with W3 Total Cache or other caching plugins? =

The Social WAll plugin should work in compatibility with most, if not all, caching plugins, but you may need to tweak the settings in order to allow the social media feeds to update successfully and display your latest posts.  If you are experiencing problems with your social media feeds not updating then try disabling either 'Page Caching' or 'Object Caching' in W3 Total Cache (or any other similar caching plugin) to see whether that fixes the problem.
